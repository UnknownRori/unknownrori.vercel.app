# Supabase Setup

Copy the content of this [sql file](https://github.com/UnknownRori/unknownrori.vercel.app/blob/main/docs/setup.sql) and paste to the supabase sql editor, it's recommended that the Supabase project is clean.

There are 2 things needed attention first one is creating user role (`claim` in this project) and securing it so it's can only be updated when you are on the Supabase dashboard and that's is only when you wanted CMS, and secondly is the typical database schema on the bottom `post` and `projects`.

Please note that this project is in development and the schema table might changes overtime.
